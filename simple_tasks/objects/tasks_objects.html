        <div>Range sum. Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end,
          and returns an array containing all numbers from start to end inclusive. Then write
           the sum function, which takes an array of numbers and returns it their sum<br>
           <br>
           As an additional task: modify the range function so that it accepts an optional 
           third argument that specifies the step value used when constructing the array. 
           If the step is not specified, the elements are increased by one, which corresponds 
           to the old behavior. Calling the range(l, 10, 2) function should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

        <div>The array is in reverse order. Arrays have a reverse method, which changes the order 
          of the elements in the array. To perform this exercise, write functions: reverseArray, which 
          accepts an array as an argument and creates a new array containing the same elements in reverse order.
           Do not use  the standard reverse method for this.

        <div>Counting letters.Write a countBs function that accepts a string as the only one
          argument and returns a number indicating how many large
          letters ~B~ is contained in this line.<br>
          Then write a countChar function that behaves like countBs, except
          that takes the second argument, indicating which ones
          symbols need to be counted (instead of counting only large ones
          letters ~B~). Rewrite countBs to use this new function.
